# CS-210
For my portfolio submission, I selected the Airgead Banking app from Project 2. This project centered around the creation of a program that allows a user to manipulate investment, monthly deposit, and interest values to learn about compound interest and investments over multi year periods. In this project, I felt that I did well with breaking the requirements up into smaller parts and tackling the problem one piece at a time. One thing I definitely think I could improve upon is the unnecessary duplication of code between the functions that calculate balance with and without monthly deposits  could have been much simpler by combining their shared code into a helper method. The most challenging part of this was less a challenge as much as it was just something I wasn't as practiced with; throwing exceptions, after going back into the book I was able to piece it together quickly. While I don't like C++ as much as I like Java or Python, completing this project and others like it have helped me to become more comfortable in C++. In all of these projects I try to make sure that if I were to ever come back to them as a resource, that I would have no trouble reading and understanding them. I think my comments are very useful in this regard.
